# Tapptitude's Android Template

A 100% Kotlin-based project template that helps us kick start our Android projects.

## Main features

- Dependencies managed
  through [Gradle version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:version-catalog) `*.toml`
- Application signing, flavors & dimensions setup done
  in  [`convention`](gradle/build-logic/convention)
  using [convention plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/sharing_build_logic_between_subprojects.html#sec:convention_plugins)
- Supports `dev` & `production` flavors out of the box
- Lays the foundation for independent core business & presentation modules [`network`](#network), [`logger`](#logger)
  , [`persistence`](#persistence), [`session`](#session)
- Dependency updates management is done through [`gradle-versions`](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin)

## Quick setup

1. Click the [`Use this template`](https://github.com/tapptitude/AndroidKotlinMVVMTemplate/generate) button on this page
   to generate your own project using this template or clone the project.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the [customize](customize.kts) Kotlin script by right clicking the file and select `Run 'customize.kts`. The script will prompt
   you to input the package and app name.
4. Sync the project.
5. Update signing configuration available in the Gradle DSL
   plugin [`SigningConfigPlugin`](gradle/build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/SigningConfigPlugin.kt)

## Gradle structure

The template uses Gradle Kotlin DSL for build setup.

Dependencies are organized into a `toml` configuration file - [`libs.versions.toml`](gradle/libs.versions.toml).

Common module setup is done using [convention plugins](gradle/build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin). The approach is based
on [https://github.com/android/nowinandroid](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).
Modules should choose the plugin they need and specify it in the `plugins { }` section of the `build.gradle.kts`.

Android specific configuration is available in the [`Android`](gradle/build-logic/convention/src/main/kotlin/configuration/Android.kt)
class.

## Architecture considerations

This template adheres to the following architectural principles:

- An [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) (Model-View-ViewModel) approach has been
  used for facilitating the GUI / business separation concerns.
- The app module uses a single-activity architecture, based on
  the [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) for navigation
  operations.
- It follows the [S.O.L.I.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) software principles which help increasing flexibility
  & maintainability while keeping the code readable.
- A modular approach was used in order to improve on
  the [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) topic, while also helping with
  isolating feature functionalities. This aspect also helps on the build speed on the long run as only modified modules
  will be recompiled at each run.

```

### app

The app module is the central place for all the other modules. It consists of a single `Activity` which hosts all the
navigation inside the app and provides basic UI functionality for `featureX` modules.

### featureHome

Represents a sample implementation of a `feature` module. It showcases how the `core` module provides all the needed
domain layer logic and the `feature` module focuses only on
the [presentation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/ui-layer) (also knows as the UI) layer.

### core

It gathers logic from `network` & `persistence` modules and creates the required infrastructure to host the business
level `Repositories` and `UseCases` that it later exposes to the `featureX` layer modules. It also hosts the UI models
and their respective converters. Most of the common business code is also hosted here (it's basically
a [domain layer](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide/domain-layer)).

### network

Provides a place to implement everything that's network related. It handles logic related to API calls, DTO models,
session handling through authentication headers and network level error handling. It
uses [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) & [okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for the network layer
implementation and [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) for `json` parsing.

### persistence

Provides a place to implement everything that's database caching related. It handles the logic for creating and migrating the database.
It also exposes a `Dao` for each database table, so that the `core` module can perform actions on each table. It uses
[Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) as the database implementation.

### session

It handles everything related to a user session and saves current login state. Provides a way to listen for such state
changes, while giving data about the current user and authentication information. It
uses [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) under the hood for
storing key-value pairs asynchronously.

### logger

Provides an implementation of basic console logging capabilities that can be easily extended to write to a file or any
other use case. It uses [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) in the underlying implementation.

### config

Provides build specific configuration to any module that needs it. Provided information is related to:

- app version code
- app version name
- app package identifier
- build flavor
- debug mode

## Code style

This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint), provided via the [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
gradle plugin.

Before pushing any code to the repository, please run the [spotlessApply](.run/spotlessApply.run.xml) configuration to fix any
code style issues. You can also do this via command line by running `./gradlew spotlessApply`
